The theme is "Modern Japanese", because:
- It expresses my background 
- It is simple, yet not too formal, elegant but has a touch of quirkiness --- exactly the style I love.
- Used square, thick, geometric style to avoid looking too "kawaii" (innocent and girly).


My inspiration comes from:
- Japanese food package design
- Japanese anime
- Japanese card games -- Hanafuda and karuta
- Taisho era inspired art
- Yumeji Takehisa

Lessons learned:
- Preparation is (almost) everything. --- Abraham Lincoln Quotes. "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe." This was so true, I spent majority of hours desiging in Figma.
