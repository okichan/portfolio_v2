# Aim

I set my theme as "Modern Japanese", because:
- It expresses my background 
- It is simple, yet not too formal, elegant but has a touch of quirkiness ― exactly the style I love.
- Used square, thick, geometric style to avoid looking too "kawaii" (means innocent and girly in Japanese).


# My inspiration comes from:
- Japanese food package design
- Japanese anime
- Japanese card games – Hanafuda and karuta
- Taisho era (1910 ~ 20s) inspired art
- Yumeji Takehisa

# Design Process 1 – Mood board



# Lessons learned:
- Preparation is (almost) everything. --- Abraham Lincoln Quotes. "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe." This was so true, I spent majority of hours desiging in Figma.
