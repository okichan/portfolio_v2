# Aim

I set my theme as "Modern Japanese", because:
- It expresses my background 
- It is simple, yet not too formal, elegant but has a touch of quirkiness ― exactly the style I love.
- Used square, thick, geometric style to avoid looking too "kawaii" (means innocent and girly in Japanese).


# My inspiration comes from:
- Japanese food package design
- Japanese anime
- Japanese card games – Hanafuda and karuta
- Taisho era (1910 ~ 20s) inspired art
- Yumeji Takehisa

# Design Process 1 – Mood board
I chose to use Pinterest because it lets me pin any images around the internet.

# Design Process 2 – Font selection
First I went for traditional brush script.

But it felt too traditional and there's no modernness so did not choose it.
-----------------------------------
Next I found this one.
![Mameron](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okichan/portfolio_v2/master/assets/mameron.png "Mameron")  

It was not bad, but it felt a bit too nostalgic and mellow which does not quite match the look and feel I wanted to achieve.

------------------------------
So I tried this one next.

and I finally am settle in this one, this font is geometric and a little sharp which I thought matches 

# Design Process 3 – Figma

# Lessons learned:
- Preparation is (almost) everything. --- Abraham Lincoln Quotes. "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe." This was so true, I spent majority of hours desiging in Figma.
- Edit your file in local unless you know what you are doing!!! 
I once wiped out my 5-hour work of `readme.md` because there was a conflict between local file and remote. And I force overwrote my latest one saved in the remote with the old one saved in the local by doing "git push -f".
This happened because I kept editing my `readme.md` in remote repository directly.  
I did create .gitignore in my local to exclude any `.md` files but it wasn't working for some reasons and thus `readme.mb` was pushed to remote when I only meant to push other files. Screw me.
